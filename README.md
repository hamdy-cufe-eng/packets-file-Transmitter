## About

Have u ever though of a packets ? then what about a packet file transmmiter !
as the title says this project allows u to convert a certain file into bytes then transfering them to a server where u should convert this bytes back to a bin file or whatever u are trying to send 
this project contains a simple trick to bypass the packet-loss thing ,in otherwords , it continously tring to send the every byte till the file full read and boom u got ur file shared from a client to ur server
